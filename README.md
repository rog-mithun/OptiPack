**OptiPack** is a Python-powered tool designed for intelligent 3D bin packing. It takes shipment and container specifications as input and uses optimization logic to pack them efficiently. It also generates **JSON outputs** and **3D visualizations**, and comes with a **REST API via Postman** for integration testing.

## 🔍 Use Case

Useful for:
- Warehouse optimization
- Shipment planning
- Supply chain and logistics simulation
- Educational demos of bin-packing logic and spatial constraints

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 📥 Accepts shipment/container data via JSON input
- 📦 Handles multiple bin types (e.g., Europallet, Container)
- 🔁 Supports item rotations and weight limits
- 🧠 Outputs structured JSON results
- 🖼️ Visualizes 3D packing results via `matplotlib`
- 🧪 Test-ready with Postman for API interaction
